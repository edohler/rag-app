# **RAG Application**

created by Erik DÃ¶hler, 28.01.2025 Bern

## **Description**

A modern **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system with a Quasar-based frontend and Python backend. It supports semantic search, metadata filtering, and document uploads for creating a custom knowledge base. The backend integrates with vector databases (e.g., ChromaDB) and LLMs for enhanced search and response generation.

3. Install dependiencies:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Create a .env file:

   ```
   LLM_API_KEY = your_LLM_api_key # for the LLM to generate the response
   SEM_CHUNK_API_KEY = your_second_LLM_api_key # for the semantic chunking
   ```
